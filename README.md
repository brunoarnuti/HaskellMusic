# Generate Music with Haskell: Hans Zimmer Inspired Soundtracks üé∂

This Haskell code generates soundtracks, replicating the style of Hans Zimmer, specifically targeting the Pirates of the Caribbean theme "One Day". This code is an excellent example of how one can represent musical notes and melodies programmatically and generate audio files using functional programming.

## Understanding the Code

This Haskell script generates pulse code modulation signals that represent musical notes. These signals are then combined to form melodies and saved as binary data.

- **Type aliases** are defined to represent physical concepts like time (Seconds), frequencies (Hz), and amplitude (Pulse). We also have Note, Semitones, and Beats to represent musical concepts.

- **pitchStandard** represents the pitch of A4 note as 440 Hz. **getHz** function calculates the frequency of a note given the number of semitones it is away from A4.

- The **note** function generates a list of pulses, which represents the sound wave of the musical note.

- **oneDay** and **hesAPirate** are representations of melodies. They are lists of pulses that were generated by calling the **getNote** function with the desired musical note and duration.

- The **freq** function generates the sound wave for a given frequency and duration.

- The **getNote** function transforms a musical note's name and its duration into pulses that make up its sound wave.

- The **wave** function selects the melody to be played. The **save** function saves the generated pulses as a binary file.

- Finally, the **play** function saves the waveform to a file and then uses the `ffplay` command to play it.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

To use this script, you'll need GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and FFplay, a simple media player based on the FFmpeg libraries.

Compile and run the script using GHC:

```bash
ghc main.hs
./main
```

This will create an audio file named "output.bin" and play it.

## Explore and Experiment üß™

Feel free to experiment with the code. You can change the melody by editing the **wave** function. Create your own melodies by using the **getNote** function and appending them to a list. You can also adjust the pitch, the tempo, and the volume to create your own version of Hans Zimmer's music!

## Limitations and Future Work üöß

This script is a simple and fun demonstration of how one can generate music programmatically. However, it lacks many features of professional music generation software. It only supports monophonic music (one note at a time) and doesn't support percussion instruments.

For future work, one can look into adding support for polyphonic music (multiple notes at a time), adding different instrument sounds, adding a GUI to make it easier to compose music, or exporting to more common audio file formats.
